# hurricane map
A graphical user interface through a web application is created to display archived tropical storms and forecast models.

This repository uses Django to serve the hurricane artificial intelligence.

This repository is also setup using a SQL database which is configured with keys unavailable from the public git repository. However, it can run on any other SQL database with the same data structure.
